I built this project in collaboration with a team of 4 other SlugAI members at UC Santa Cruz. PieFi was an all-in-one startup accelerator platform designed to streamline the process of launching and growing a startup. The platform offered a comprehensive suite of tools and resources to help founders manage various aspects of their business, from ideation to funding and growth. We worked with local startup serial founder Sol Lipman to build a new generation of VC that allowed large numbers of developers and founders to connect, build, and ship rapidly together. The platform included daily progress vlogs that were automatically processed and stitched together into instagram-ready build-in-public videos. The platform also featured a discord-like community hub where founders could connect, share ideas, and collaborate on projects; the Oracle provided personalized guidance and support as well as assisting with making connections and finding a team. Additionally, PieFi included a Claude Code instance to help democratize access to development tools and resources, allowing founders to quickly prototype and iterate on their ideas.

I worked on an automated email outreach and lead discovery system, where we ingested a user's profile information and searched for hundreds of potentially interested investors, partners, and customers, and then automatically reached out to them with personalized cold emails. The system used a combination of semantic people search, natural language processing, and machine learning to identify and prioritize leads based on their relevance. The email outreach component leveraged an LLM to generate personalized email content that was tailored to each recipient's interests and needs and reflected how the user's startup could provide them value, increasing the chances of a positive response. The system also included analytics and reporting features to track the effectiveness of the outreach campaigns and optimize future efforts.
