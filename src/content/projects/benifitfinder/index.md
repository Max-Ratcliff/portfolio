BenefitFinder is an AI-powered tool designed to simplify the discovery of student resources, including government aid, scholarships, discounts, and local educational initiatives. By leveraging Google's Firebase and Gemini services, BenefitFinder streamlines the often complicated process of identifying and applying for benefits.

The backend utilizes Firebase and Gemini AI to securely manage user data and efficiently parse extensive federal, state, and local databases. The frontend, built with Typescript, provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface where students answer a brief series of questions regarding their background and circumstances. BenefitFinder then returns a tailored list of applicable resources and clear eligibility criteria before guiding you through the application process and generating a the necessary documents to apply for the benefits.

The project was developed during the CruzHacks 2025 hackathon, where we were awarded the "Best Beginner Hack" prize. My role in this project was primarily focused on backend development, where I worked closely with Firebase and Gemini to ensure seamless integration and data management.
