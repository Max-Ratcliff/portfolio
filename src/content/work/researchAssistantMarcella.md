Performing research under Dr. Marcella Gomez on automated control of synthetic biological systems.
Engineered a fully automated data pipeline in Python using CellPose to segment and process large batches of bacterial spore microscopy images.
Integrated the pipeline into a closed-loop control system, enabling real-time spore population prediction and automated environmental adjustments with 0.3ms processing latency per image.
Eliminated manual image segmentation in ImageJ/Fiji, standardizing data extraction consistency and reducing processing time by over 95%.
