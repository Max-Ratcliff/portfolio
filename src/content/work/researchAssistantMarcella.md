Performing research under Dr. Marcella Gomez, we are studying bacterial germination with the goal of applying control theory to bacterial populations. I am currently working on a data extraction pipeline that leverages the cellpose computer vision model to automate data extraction from microscopy images of germinating bacteria, and feeds cleaned data of the cell characteristics into an LSTM model to predict next frame germination patterns. This project involves image processing, data cleaning, and time series prediction using machine learning techniques. My pipeline is written in Python and the code is available on my GitHub.
